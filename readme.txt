== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need my own AdSense account to make this work? =

No. You only need your own AdSense account if you want to display your ads in the event of an author not setting up their own ads.

= Will this work on my Multi User (MU) installation? =

This has not been tested in a MU environment.

= Can I make my ads align left or right? =

Yes. If you would like your ads to align left, use the shortcode [MAA align="left"]. The same is true for center and right.  
Samples:  
[MAA] will not center or wrap text.  
[MAA align="left"] will make your ad align left and text wrap around it.  
[MAA align="center"] will make your ad centered and text wrap NOT around it.  
[MAA align="right"] will make your ad align right and text wrap around it.
